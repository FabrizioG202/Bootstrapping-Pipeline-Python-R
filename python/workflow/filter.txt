? "#exclude" indicates that the next lines, up until another "#exclude" or "#include" is found are to be excluded from the analysis.
? type: indicates that command refers to all the features with the specified type.
? line: indicates that command refers to all the features with the specified cell line.

? The following is an example file:
? #exclude: ? exclude the following stuff.
? line: HMEC ? exclude all features with the cell line HMEC.
? type: CAGE ? exclude all features with the type CAGE.
? 
? #include: ? include the following stuff.
? HMEC/CAGE ? include all features with the cell line HMEC and the type CAGE. Note that this has an higher priority than the rest so even if any feature belonging to the HMEC and CAGE is excluded, it will be included.

# Cluster Analysis Pipelines based on Bootstrapping
This repository contains the following pipelines:
## Boostrapping pipeline 1:
Check for clusters which are enriched in a particular feature set using bootstrapping. To do so, a large amount of random genomes are generated.
## Boostrapping pipeline 2:
Check how CTCF enrichment is involved in the 3D structure of the genome.
